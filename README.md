## Installation
To install and use this project, you will need Node.js and yarn.
1. Download or clone the git repository to your computer.
2. In terminal, install the project dependencies using the command `yarn` or `yarn install`.
3. Setup your ENV.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the front-end server using the command `yarn dev`. This should open a browser window with the app running.

If everything went well, you should now be able to use the app. Note that you may need to launch the back-end of the project by cloning the SugarSense-Server
